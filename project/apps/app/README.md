Task 1:

I fetched the list of Pokémon using Axios, a powerful and flexible HTTP client for making requests. Here's a quick breakdown:

Install Axios: Used npm install axios to add Axios to the project.

Fetch Data: Made a GET request to the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151) using Axios.

Update State: Upon receiving the API response, updated the component’s state with the list of Pokémon.

This process involves setting up Axios, making the request, and handling the response to display the data in the component.
